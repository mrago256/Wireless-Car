This needs to be compiled through processing for whatever architecture you are using.

The Key_Motor_Speed_Control.ino is to be used with the Key_Motor_Control.pde as it allows for usage of a keyboard to control the values.  It is the newest and most up to date code, and it is also cleaned up a bit more and is reformatted.  If you decide on mouse control, Mouse_Motor_Speed_Control.ino is to be used with Mouse_Motor_Control.pde.  It is not as up to date and has sloppy code.
